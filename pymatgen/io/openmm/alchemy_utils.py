    """
    A HalfReaction stores the indices of the atoms that participate in the "left"
    or "right" half of a reaction. It is instantiated when a AlchemicalReaction is
    applied to a specific set of molecules to create a ReactiveSystem.

    Half Reactions are intended to be paired with a partner HalfReaction to form a
    full reaction. These are referred to as the "left" and "right" half reactions,
    the ordering is arbitrary.
    For example, if we want a condensation reaction, the "left" reaction might include
    the alcohol atoms and the "right" reaction might include the carboxylic acid atoms.

    The HalfReaction stores indices involved in creating bonds, deleting bonds, and
    deleting atoms. It also stores a "trigger atom", when the trigger atom of one
    half reaction is within a cutoff distance of the trigger atom of the other half
    reaction, the reaction will occur.

    Args:
        create_bonds: a list of atoms that form new bonds. Each atom in the list
            will form a bond with the corresponding atom in the partner HalfReaction.
            So if create bonds is [0, 1] and the partner HalfReaction has create bonds
            [2, 3], then atoms 0 and 2 will form a bond, and atoms 1 and 3 will form a
            bond.
        delete_bonds: a list of tuples of atom indices to delete bonds between. Each
            tuple should contain two atom indices and the bond between those atoms will
            be deleted.
        delete_atoms: a list of atom indices to delete. These atoms will be deleted
            and any bonds they are involved in will be deleted.
        trigger_atom: the atom index that triggers the reaction when in proximity

        first tuple of the create_bonds list. For example, if the create_bonds list in the

        [("C1", "O1"), ("C2", "O2")], then the left trigger atom will be the C1 atom, and the right
